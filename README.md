# bayesian_analysis_toy_model

This notebook contains code that performs bayesian optimization on a toy model including a linear term, oscillations, and decay with added noise. The noise variance sigma**2 is assigned using an anaology with the equipartition theorem in statistical mechanics that is in line with the maximum entropy (ME) method proposed by Jaynes.

The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in obtaining marginal posterior probability densities as well as verify that the results are intuitive and reasonable.
